# # Object Oriented Programming (contd..)
# - 4 Pillars of OOP

# ## Encapsulation
# - Technique of keeping internal state of object hidden from the outside.
# - Achieved using private attributes and providing public methods to access and update them.
# - Syntax: __varname

# ## Abstraction
# - Concept of hiding the complex implementaion details and showing only the necessary features of an object.
# - Achieved by using Abstract class and method.

# ### Abstraction Class and Method
# -


# ## Inheritance
# - Mechanism of creating a new class based on an existing class, by inheriting properties (attributes and/or methods)
# - Parent Class: The class from where the features are inherited from.
# - Child class: The class that inherits the features.
# - Benefits: Classes are created easily, easy maintenance.
# - Syntax : Parent class name in Child class ()

# ## Polymorphism
# - Ability to present the same interface for different data types.
# - Allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.
# - Syntax:  outside function - passing an attribute of a object.
