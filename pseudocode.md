- Plain language decription of the steps in an algorithm or a program
- Bridge between the programs logic and the actual code

- Helps to understand and plan the program logic so easier to code.
- Improve collaboration in team projects.
- helps with troubleshooting.
- identify the core areas of the programming that needs to be done.
## Characteristics:
- Plain language: Simple and understandable
- Structured: follow aproper logic sequence
- Abstracted: focuses on logic maore than the syntax
- Detailed  : Thorough walkthrough thathelps explain the logic.

## Basic constructs:
- Sequential:
~~~
    - step 1: do this
    - step 2: do that
~~~
- Conditional:
~~~
    - If condition Then
       - do something
    - else 
        - do something else
    - end if
~~~
- Loops
~~~
    - while condition meets
        - Do something
    - end while

    - for each item in a collection / sequence
        - do something
    - end for
~~~
## Example 1 : Calculate the sum of a list of numbers
~~~
    Initialise sum to 0
    FOR each number in the list
        ADD the number to sum
    END FOR
    Print sum
~~~
## Example 2: find the max number ina list:
~~~
    Initialise max to the first number of the list
    FOR each number in the list
        IF number is greater than max THEN
            SET max to number
        END IF
    END FOR
    Print max
~~~
